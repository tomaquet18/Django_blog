# Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomaquet18/dgv_blog
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd Django_blog/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up the database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
5. Install the required dependencies for the frontend (Vue.js):
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
6. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the development server for the frontend:
```bash
npm run serve
```
7. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to see the blog.

Note: By default, Vue.js uses port 8080 for development. If this port is already in use on your system, you can specify a different port by modifying the configuration in the frontend/vue.config.js file.
8. Access the admin panel by visiting http://localhost:8000/admin to create user accounts and manage posts.

Now you have the backend server and frontend development server up and running, allowing you to use the blog locally.
